	<b>The Sorting Strategy to use when prioritising jobs.</b>
	<br/>
	<li><b>First in First Out</b> Use normal Jenkins scheduling where jobs get run as they are added to queue.</li>
	<li><b>Absolute</b> <i>Lower</i> priority is scheduled before <i>higher</i> priority.</li>
	<li><b>Fair Queueing</b> Each priority is regarded as <i>bucket</i> the scheduler tries to distribute resources evenly over the buckets, each bucket is sorted intermally with <i>First In First Out</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Weighted Fair Queueing</b> As <i>Fair Queueing</i> but <i>lower</i> priority value gets more resources than <i>higher</i> value.</li>
